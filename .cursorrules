# Project Context
- This project is a Python-based automation tool.
- **Python Environment**: 
  - Python Version: 3.13.11
  - Python Path: `C:/Users/sinde/miniforge3/envs/cony-env/python.exe`
- **Key Installed Packages**:
  - `selenium`: 4.39.0
  - `xlwings`: 0.33.19
  - `openpyxl`: 3.1.5
  - `webdriver-manager`: 4.0.2
  - `requests`: 2.32.5
  - `pyinstaller`: 6.17.0
  - `pywin32`: 311
- It scrapes product ranking data using Selenium (Chrome) and updates an Excel file (`.xlsm`) using xlwings.
- The system runs on Windows.

# Development Guidelines
- Use ONLY the installed Python version and packages listed above.
- Do not add new dependencies without explicit permission.


# Code Style
- Language: Python
- **Beginner-Friendly Coding**:
  - Write code that is easy to read and understand.
  - Avoid complex inline programming (e.g., long list comprehensions) or advanced functional programming (e.g., heavily nested lambda functions, complex decorators).
  - Use clear and explicit logic, even if it requires more lines of code (e.g., using `for` loops instead of complex `map`/`filter`).
- **Consistency with Existing Code**:
  - Maintain existing function names, variable names, and output messages as much as possible.
  - Do not rename or refactor existing logic unless it is absolutely necessary for functionality or requested by the user.
- Comments: MUST use Korean for all comments and log messages to help the user understand the logic.

- Formatting: Follow PEP 8 guidelines.
- Type Hinting: Encouraged for function signatures to improve clarity.


# Key Components
- `main.py`: Entry point. Orchestrates the flow.
- `web_handler.py`: Selenium related logic. Handles `Chrome_profile` for persistent login sessions.
- `excel_handler.py`: Excel manipulation using `xlwings`. Must preserve VBA/Macros (`.xlsm`).
- `config.py`: Configuration constants.

# Rules & Best Practices
- **Excel Handling**:
  - Always handle Excel carefully to avoid zombie processes.
  - Use `xlwings` for `.xlsm` files to keep macros intact.
  - Ensure `app.quit()` or `wb.close()` is called in `finally` blocks.
- **Selenium**:
  - Use `Chrome_profile` to maintain login state.
  - Handle `kill_chrome_processes` to clean up before starting.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Use `try-except` blocks for robustness, especially for external IO (Web/Excel).
  - Print user-friendly error messages in Korean.
